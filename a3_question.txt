/*
This assignment introduces an example concerning World War II capital ships.
It involves the following relations:

Classes(class, type, country, numGuns, bore, displacement)
Ships(name, class, launched)  --launched is for year launched
Battles(name, date_fought)
Outcomes(ship, battle, result)

Ships are built in "classes" from the same design, and the class is usually
named for the first ship of that class.

Relation Classes records the name of the class,
the type (bb for battleship or bc for battlecruiser),
the country that built the ship, the number of main guns,
the bore (diameter of the gun barrel, in inches)
of the main guns, and the displacement (weight, in tons).

Relation Ships records the name of the ship, the name of its class,
and the year in which the ship was launched.

Relation Battles gives the name and date of battles involving these ships.

Relation Outcomes gives the result (sunk, damaged, or ok)
for each ship in each battle.

-- Exercise 3. (4 points)

-- Write the following modifications.

-- 1.	(2 points) Two of the three battleships of the Italian Vittorio Veneto class â€“
-- Vittorio Veneto and Italia â€“ were launched in 1940;
-- the third ship of that class, Roma, was launched in 1942.
-- Each had 15-inch guns and a displacement of 41,000 tons.
-- Insert these facts into the database.

-- Write your sql statements here.


-- 2.	(1 point) Delete all classes with fewer than three ships.

-- Write your sql statement here.


-- 3.	(1 point) Modify the Classes relation so that gun bores are measured in centimeters
-- (one inch = 2.5 cm) and displacements are measured in metric tons (one metric ton = 1.1 ton).

-- Write your sql statement here.



-- Exercise 4.  (9 points)
-- Add the following constraints using views with check option.

--1. (3 points) No ship can be in battle before it is launched.

-- Write your sql statement here.

-- Now we can try some insertion on this view.
INSERT INTO OutcomesView (ship, battle, result)
VALUES('Musashi', 'North Atlantic','ok');
-- This insertion, as expected, should fail since Musashi is launched in 1942,
-- while the North Atlantic battle took place on 27-MAY-41.


-- 2. (3 points) No ship can be launched before
-- the ship that bears the name of the first shipâ€™s class.

-- Write your sql statement here.

-- Now we can try some insertion on this view.
INSERT INTO ShipsV(name, class, launched)
VALUES ('AAA','Kongo',1912);
-- This insertion, as expected, should fail since ship Kongo (first ship of class Kongo) is launched in 1913.


--3. (3 points) No ship fought in a battle that was at a later date than another battle in which that ship was sunk.

-- Write your sql statements here.

-- Now we can try some insertion on this view.
INSERT INTO OutcomesV(ship, battle, result)
VALUES('Bismarck', 'Guadalcanal', 'ok');
-- This insertion, as expected, should fail since 'Bismarck' was sunk in
-- the battle of North Atlantic, in 1941, whereas the battle of Guadalcanal happened in 1942.
